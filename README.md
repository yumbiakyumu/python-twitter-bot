# Python Twitter Bots

ü§ñ Welcome to the Twitter Bot Developer Portal! üê¶

## Introduction

This repository contains three powerful Python Twitter bots to automate various tasks on Twitter. However, before you start using these bots, please follow the steps below to create your own developer portal and obtain Twitter API keys:

## Step 1: Create a Developer Account

1. Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) and apply for a developer account.
2. Provide the necessary information about your project and wait for Twitter's approval.

## Step 2: Create an App

1. Once your developer account is approved, log in to the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).
2. Click on the "Projects & Apps" tab and create a new project.
3. Inside your project, create a new "App" to access the Twitter API.

## Step 3: Obtain API Keys

1. After creating the app, navigate to the "Keys and tokens" section.
2. Here, you will find your "API key," "API secret key," "Bearer token," "Access token," and "Access token secret."

## Step 4: Replace the "xxxxxxx" with Your API Keys

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open each of the three Python scripts and replace the "xxxxxxx" placeholders with your obtained API keys.

## Usage

Now that you've set up your developer portal and replaced the API keys, you can run the Python scripts to start using the Twitter bots:

1. `twitter_bot.py`: This script interacts with the Twitter API to post tweets, like, and retweet based on your customization.

2. `twitter_bot_like.py`: This bot likes (favorites) tweets containing the specified keyword(s).

3. `twitter_bot_retweet.py`: This bot retweets tweets containing the specified keyword(s).

## Important Note

Please use these bots responsibly and in compliance with Twitter's API usage policies. Avoid excessive liking or retweeting to prevent potential account suspensions.

Happy tweeting! üöÄüê¶
